# String-Decoder
Implement std::string decode(std::string exp, std::string code); in stringdecoding.cpp using provided StackType and QueType. Add chars from exp not in code in order, then append reversed code chars. Use std::string::at() and find(). Initialize variables explicitly. Do not modify .h files.

*Still have some problems as of 10/8 -- working on it*
